                                                   ----------------------         JAVA            ---------------------

 1)  Class Name should be same as File name
 2)  If we use
                 class ABC (that contains psvm) then file name can be either           ABC.java      or      anything.java

 3)  If we use
                 public class ABC  (that contains psvm) then file name                  MUST BE   ABC.java

 4) class ABC    <----  present, its a Default Class(means having "default" access modifier)


Modifier      Package  Subclass  World

public          Yes      Yes     Yes

protected       Yes      Yes     No

Default (no
modifier)       Yes       No     No

private         No        No     No


 5) Constructor
      - Special Methods Used to allocate/initialise memory for OBJECT
      - JVM provides a Default constructor of class ABC always present
      - Constructor has Same Name as the Class Name
      - Doesn't Return Anything
      - Called only ONCE at the time of Obj Creation
      - Creates an instance(Obj) in the Heap Memory

    While Creating OBJECT of a certain CLASS using new() keyword a default constructor is always CALLED.(below ex)
    Student obj = new Student();

    While making an Obj of Class B that extends A then it will call the constructor of Class A + Class B both.
    Calling Child Class - Constructor of Parent and Constructor of Child executes.
          runs sequence: ConstChild + ConstParent

 7) If 2 Class Present then you have to use public keyboard before the class having MAIN Method, then name the file with that
               name only(otherwise it will get confuse which class is having the MAIN Method).


 8)   FEATURES   ::
      - Platform-Independent  ---->  is that the Java Compiled Code(byte code) can run on all operating systems .
      - Multi Threaded        ---->  Ability to run multiple threads concurrently at the same time .
      - Portable              ---->  to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.
      - Encapsulation         ---->  Wrapping up of data and information under a single unit
      - Polymorphism          ---->  Method Overriding( RunTime Time Polymorphism )  +  Method OverLoading( CompileTime Time Polymorphism )
      - Inheritance           ---->  Child/SubClass  inherits the METHODS of the Parent Class


 9)   Static Method in Java   -->   * Access static method() and fields using Class Name       [ ClassName.methodName(args) ]
                                    * NO NEED  to Create Object/Instance of the Class
                                    * We cannot access/print Non-Static Variables inside Static Methods

 10) Aggregation  --->   HAS A Relationship
     Composition  --->   IS A PART OF Relationship (both dependent)
     Interface    --->   IS A Relationship


  11) STEPS ::    javac  <file_name>  ->  <file_name> will be original file name, but after conpiling successfully it will create a .class file
                    with the same name as that of the Main Class that contains the MAIN FUNCTION in Java.


          Compile  :  javac  <file_name>
                      java <class_name>


  12) The access level MODIFIERS in Java are:

           public - accessible everywhere in the application
           protected - accessible in the same package and to subclasses regardless of package
           nothing (default) - accessible in the same package
           private - visible only to code in the same class (including nested classes)


  13)  Main Method :  Can be OVERRIDDEN ,  OVERLOADED , RECURSE
                        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-48-overloading-main-in-java/



   14)  super() -> keywords used to call the constructor of the Parent Class
        this() -> keywords used to call the constructor of itself

      Method Overriding  OR  RunTime Time Polymorphism
                   --  Subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class


     15)
     Vector calss is thread safe (single thread) - LOW performance than ArrayList

     16) In Java, String values are stored in a special memory area known as the String Pool, which is part of the Heap memory.
               String str = "Hello!"

          When string is created with new keyword, then new memory is allocate in the Heap
               String str = new String("Hello!");

          And in order to save the string in the string pool use .intern() func
