                                                   ----------------------         JAVA            ---------------------

 1)  Class Name should be same as File name
 2)  If we use 
                 class ABC (that contains psvm) then file name can be either           ABC.java      or      anything.java
 
 3)  If we use 
                 public class ABC  (that contains psvm) then file name                  MUST BE   ABC.java                                                   
  
 4) class ABC    <----  present, its a Default Class(means having "default" access modifier)

 5) Constructor
      - JVM provides a Default constructor of class ABC always present
      - Constructor has Same Name as the Class Name
      - Doesn't Return Anything
      - Used to alocate memrory for OBJECT
      - Creates an instance(Obj) in the Heap Memory

    While Creating OBJECT of a certain CLASS a default constructor is always CALLED.(below ex)
    Student obj = new Student();


 7) If 2 Class Present then you have to use public keyboard before the class having MAIN Method, then name the file with that
               name only(otherwise it will get confuse which class is having the MAIN Method).


 8)   FEATURES   ::
      - Platform-Independent  ---->  is that the Java Compiled Code(byte code) can run on all operating systems .    
      - Multi Threaded        ---->  Ability to run multiple threads concurrently at the same time .
      - Portable              ---->  to carry the Java bytecode to any platform .   
      
      - Encapsulation         ---->  Wrapping up of data and information under a single unit
      - Polymorphism          ---->  Method Overriding  +  Method OverLoading
      - Inheritance           ---->  Child/SubClass  inherits the METHODS of the Parent Class


 9)   Static Method in Java   -->   * Access static method() and fields using Class Name       [ ClassName.methodName(args) ]
                                    * NO NEED  to Create Object/Instance of the Class
                                    * We cannot print Non - Static Variables inside Static Methods



 10)  


  6) STEPS ::    * javac  <file_name>  ->  <file_name> will be original file name, but after conpiling successfully it will create a .class file
                    with the same name as that of the Main Class that contains the MAIN FUNCTION in Java. 


  
          Compile  :  javac  <file_name>
                      java <class_name>
