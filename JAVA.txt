 1)  Class Name should be same as File name
 2)  If we use 
                 class ABC (that contains psvm) then file name can be either           ABC.java      or      anything.java
 
 3)  If we use 
                 public class ABC  (that contains psvm) then file name                  MUST BE   ABC.java                                                   
  
 4) class ABC    <----  present, its a Default Class(means having "default" access modifier)

 5) Constructor
      - Special Methods Used to allocate/initialise memrory for OBJECT
      - JVM provides a Default constructor of class ABC always present
      - Constructor has Same Name as the Class Name
      - Doesn't Return Anything
      - Called only ONCE at the time of Obj Creation
      - Creates an instance(Obj) in the Heap Memory

    While Creating OBJECT of a certain CLASS using new() keyword a default constructor is always CALLED.(below ex)
    Student obj = new Student();

    While making an Obj of Class B that extends A then it will call the constructor of Class A + Class B both.


 7) If 2 Class Present then you have to use public keyboard before the class having MAIN Method, then name the file with that
               name only(otherwise it will get confuse which class is having the MAIN Method).


 8)   FEATURES   ::
      - Platform-Independent  ---->  is that the Java Compiled Code(byte code) can run on all operating systems .    
      - Multi Threaded        ---->  Ability to run multiple threads concurrently at the same time .
      - Portable              ---->  to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.   
      - Encapsulation         ---->  Wrapping up of data and information under a single unit
      - Polymorphism          ---->  Method Overriding( RunTime Time Polymorphism )  +  Method OverLoading( CompileTime Time Polymorphism )
      - Inheritance           ---->  Child/SubClass  inherits the METHODS of the Parent Class


 9)   Static Method in Java   -->   * Access static method() and fields using Class Name       [ ClassName.methodName(args) ]
                                    * NO NEED  to Create Object/Instance of the Class
                                    * We cannot print Non - Static Variables inside Static Methods
                                    * Not - Static Variable cannot be accessed from Static Methods

 10) Aggregation  --->   HAS A Relationship
     Composition  --->   IS A PART OF Relationship (both dependent)
     Interface    --->   IS A Relationship


  11) STEPS ::    javac  <file_name>  ->  <file_name> will be original file name, but after conpiling successfully it will create a .class file
                    with the same name as that of the Main Class that contains the MAIN FUNCTION in Java. 

  
          Compile  :  javac  <file_name>
                      java <class_name>   


  12) The access level MODIFIERS in Java are:

           public - accessible everywhere in the application
           protected - accessible in the same package and to subclasses regardless of package
           nothing (default) - accessible in the same package
           private - visible only to code in the same class (including nested classes)


  13)  Main Method :  Can be OVERRIDDEN ,  OVERLOADED , RECURSE
